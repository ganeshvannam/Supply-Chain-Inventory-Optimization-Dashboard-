# Supply Chain Inventory Optimization Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
An **end-to-end SQL + Python + Power BI project** focused on optimizing inventory planning across multiple warehouse regions.  
The dashboard calculates and visualizes **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**, **Reorder Point (ROP)**, and **Safety Stock** metrics to reduce overstock, minimize stockouts, and improve procurement decisions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze SKU-level demand across 4 warehouse regions.  
- Calculate **EOQ, ROP, and Safety Stock** using SQL + Python.  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to monitor:  
  - Inventory coverage and stockout risk  
  - Supplier lead times and delays  
  - Reorder alerts and procurement KPIs  
- Demonstrate measurable improvements:  
  - ðŸ“‰ **20% reduction in overstock**  
  - ðŸ“ˆ **15% improvement in replenishment accuracy**

---

## ðŸ§® Key Inventory Formulas
- **EOQ:** âˆš((2 Ã— Demand Ã— Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost)  
- **ROP:** (Average Daily Demand Ã— Lead Time) + Safety Stock  
- **Safety Stock:** z Ã— ÏƒL (where z = 1.645 for 95% service level)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Identified **slow-moving SKUs** and supplier delays through lead time variance analysis.  
- Highlighted **stockout risks** by comparing demand with safety stock thresholds.  
- Improved procurement efficiency by aligning **current stock vs EOQ vs ROP** at the warehouse level.  
- Delivered **quarterly replenishment accuracy trends**, supporting smarter planning decisions.
