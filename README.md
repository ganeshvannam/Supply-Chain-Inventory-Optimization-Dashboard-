# Supply Chain Inventory Optimization Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
A **SQL + Python + Power BI** project that analyzes supply chain data to optimize inventory planning across multiple warehouse regions.  
The system calculates **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**, **Reorder Point (ROP)**, and **Safety Stock** metrics to reduce overstock, minimize stockouts, and improve procurement decisions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Analyze SKU-level demand across warehouse regions.  
- Calculate **EOQ, ROP, and Safety Stock** using SQL and Python.  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize inventory coverage, stockout risk, supplier delays, and reorder alerts.  
- Demonstrate improvements in simulated scenarios:
  - 20% reduction in overstock  
  - 15% improvement in replenishment accuracy

## ðŸ§® Inventory Formulas
- **EOQ** = âˆš( (2 Ã— Demand Ã— Ordering Cost) / Holding Cost )  
- **ROP** = (Average Daily Demand Ã— Lead Time) + Safety Stock  
- **Safety Stock** = z Ã— Ïƒ<sub>L</sub> (where *z* = 1.645 for 95% service level)
